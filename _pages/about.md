<div class="about-page-content">

<p class="tagline">Privacy-focused architect of decentralized, secure systems in AI and blockchain.</p>

<p class="intro-text">I am a researcher in distributed systems and ubiquitous computing, with a focus on secure protocols and privacy-preserving architectures. My work examines blockchain security, secure multiparty computation, and context-aware systems. I have contributed to national research programs through work at CSIRO and previously held roles with IBM and UNSW that centered on protocol design for data integrity and cross-system interoperability. My publications address federated learning, zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain consensus mechanisms, and context-aware computing in ubiquitous environments. I work across African and Australian research ecosystems on cryptographic protocols and privacy-preserving system design.</p>

<h2>Research Focus</h2>

<p>I architect <strong>privacy-by-design systems</strong> that embed trust into the foundation of digital ecosystems. My work spans distributed systems (70%) and ubiquitous computing (30%):</p>

<h2>Current Work</h2>

<p>As a <strong>Research & Innovation Consultant</strong> specializing in secure decentralized systems, I design and deploy blockchain-based data integrity systems and verifiable AI infrastructures for fintech and energy startups. My work focuses on architecting scalable, privacy-preserving, and interoperable blockchain solutions with applications in energy systems, carbon markets, and decentralized identity.</p>

<p><strong>Current research areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain-based data integrity systems for fintech and energy applications</li>
<li>Verifiable AI infrastructures with explainability and traceability</li>
<li>Hyperledger Fabric networks for identity management and permissioned data exchange</li>
<li>Scalability, performance, and cryptographic audits for blockchain ventures</li>
<li>DevOps pipelines for blockchain platforms with containerized testing and CI/CD</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Contributions</h2>

<p>I completed my <strong>PhD at UNSW (2024)</strong> on "Blockchain-based Decentralized Energy Systems," developing four novel frameworks:</p>

<h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

<blockquote class="philosophy-quote">
  <strong>Embed trust into the foundation of digital ecosystems. Architect privacy as a right, not a feature.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe in building systems that prioritize user privacy and data sovereignty from the ground up, ensuring that security and trust are fundamental properties rather than afterthoughts.</p>
