## Background

Smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa face significant barriers to accessing mechanized services (tractors, harvesters, threshers) due to fragmented markets, lack of credit, and information asymmetry. Traditional booking systems rely on cash payments and phone calls, creating inefficiencies and excluding farmers without mobile money accounts. The Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CTA) and Hello Tractor identified blockchain and IoT as potential solutions to create transparent, accessible, and efficient agricultural service markets.

## Problem Statement

**How can we create a decentralized platform that enables smallholder farmers to book, pay for, and track mechanized agricultural services using blockchain and IoT technologies?**

The agricultural service challenges include:

- **Market fragmentation**: Service providers and farmers lack efficient matching mechanisms
- **Payment barriers**: Cash-only transactions limit market participation
- **Credit access**: Smallholder farmers lack credit history for traditional loans
- **Service tracking**: No reliable way to verify service delivery and quality
- **Demand prediction**: Service providers cannot efficiently predict and plan for demand

## System Architecture

Agri-Wallet integrates **blockchain, IoT, and AI** into a unified agricultural services platform:

### Platform Components

1. **Digital Booking Platform**: Mobile app for farmers to book tractor services
2. **Token-based Payment System**: Blockchain tokens for service payments and credit
3. **IoT-enabled Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of tractor usage and field operations
4. **AI Demand Prediction**: Machine learning models forecasting service demand
5. **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated service agreements and payment settlement

### Key Innovation

Agri-Wallet was among the first systems to combine **blockchain-based payments, IoT device tracking, and AI demand prediction** for agricultural services in developing markets.

## Key Features

- **Digital booking platform** for tractor services, accessible via SMS/USSD for feature phones
- **Token-based payment** and credit logging, enabling credit for farmers without bank accounts
- **Farmer-facing mobile wallet** with blockchain backend, ensuring transaction security
- **Integration of field data** from IoT devices, providing service verification and quality metrics

## Technologies

- **Blockchain (Permissioned Ledger)**: Hyperledger Fabric for transaction security
- **AI-based Demand Prediction**: Machine learning forecasting service demand patterns
- **IoT-enabled Tractor Monitoring**: GPS and sensor data from tractors
- **Smart Contract-enabled Booking**: Automated service agreements
- **SMS/USSD Mobile Integration**: Accessible via basic mobile phones

## My Role

As **Blockchain and Mobile Integration Engineer** at IBM Research Africa, I developed:

- **Mobile wallet integration layer**: Connected mobile apps to blockchain backend
- **Smart contract logic**: Implemented booking, payment, and dispute resolution contracts
- **Secure token transaction protocol**: Designed cryptographic protocols for token transfers
- **Field deployment support**: Deployed and trained users in rural Kenya
- **Patent co-inventor**: Co-invented blockchain-based agricultural service platform (US11497156B2)
- **Conference presentations**: Presented at ICT4D 2019 and AI for Good Summit

## Implementation Details

The Agri-Wallet system was implemented through:

### System Performance

- **Transaction throughput**: 100+ bookings per day per region
- **Payment success rate**: 98%+ for token-based transactions
- **Service verification**: 95%+ accuracy in IoT-based service tracking
- **User adoption**: 2,000+ active farmers in pilot phase

## Outcomes

- **Over 2,000 farmers served** in pilot deployment across Kenya
- **Granted patent** (US11497156B2) for blockchain-based agricultural service platform
- **Presented at ICT4D 2019** and AI for Good Summit
- **Featured in IBM Research Africa portfolio** as flagship development project

## Impact

Agri-Wallet addresses critical challenges in agricultural technology and financial inclusion:

- **Agricultural technology**: Digital transformation of mechanization services
- **Blockchain for development**: Practical application of blockchain in developing markets
- **Financial inclusion**: Credit access for unbanked smallholder farmers
- **IoT-enabled mechanization**: Data-driven optimization of agricultural services

## Status

**Completed** (2018-2019) - Industry-led prototype with NGO/Startup collaboration. Patented. The system design continues to inform agricultural technology initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Research Contributions

This work demonstrates:

1. **Blockchain applications** in agricultural development
2. **IoT-blockchain integration** for service verification
3. **AI-driven demand prediction** for resource-constrained markets
4. **Financial inclusion** through token-based credit systems
